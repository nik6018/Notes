The Basics of the GIT
--------------------
	
	1. Git is based on the Graph theroy 
		=>Nodes : as Commits
		=>Edges : as references or branches

	2. Most VCS only store the recent version of the file 
	   =>Git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a miniature 
	     filesystem. 
	   =>Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, 
             it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that 
             moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. 
	   =>To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn.t store the file again, 
	     just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. 
	     Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots.

	3. In git everthing is local and as the changes to the remote repo doesnt need to commited
	   immedietly so the working offline is very easy and require to push only when it is required

	4. Git Mainly has 3 states
		-----Working-------Staging-------.git/repo--------
		
		working => this is the state when you are modifying the files after a checkout  and havent done any 
			   git operation

		staging => this state is achieved when modification to the files are been done
			   and they are queqed up to commit 
			   OR
			   (here the snapshot of the entire  repo is also taken)

		git dir => here the queqed up files which are ready to commit are commit permenantly commit to the
		           to the the DB of the git
			   OR
			   (here the snapshot are permenantly commit to the DB)

		Summary :
				The basic Git workflow goes something like this:

					a.You modify files in your working directory.

					b.You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area.

					c.You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that 
                                          snapshot permanently to your Git directory.
	
					
				Remember that each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: tracked or untracked. 
				Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged. 
				Untracked files are everything else . any files in your working directory that were not in your last 
				snapshot and are not in your staging area. 
				When you first clone a repository, all of your files will be tracked and unmodified because you just 
				checked them out and haven.t edited anything.

Commands
--------
	
	git status => shows the current branch and shows the modified files and staged files
		      Untracked basically means that Git sees a file you didn.t have in the previous snapshot (commit)
	git diff => gives all the differences between the staged file and the previous snapshot of the file
	git commit => this will commit all the files that were staged (remember)and not the changes that were modified after
		      staging the file . It opens ur default editor and shows the git status after commit . if we pass -v as 
		      as extra param to the command it also store the diff of the files between the previous and the current
		      snapshot .
