The Basics of the GIT
--------------------
	
	1. Git is based on the Graph theroy 
		=>Nodes : as Commits
		=>Edges : as references or branches

	2. Most VCS only store the recent version of the file 
	   =>Git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a miniature 
		 filesystem. 
	   =>Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, 
         it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that 
         moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. 
	   =>To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn.t store the file again, 
		 just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. 
		 Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots.

	3. In git everthing is local and as the changes to the remote repo doesnt need to commited
	   immedietly so the working offline is very easy and require to push only when it is required

	4. Git Mainly has 3 states
		-----Working-------Staging-------.git/repo--------
		
		working => this is the state when you are modifying the files after a checkout  and havent done any 
				   git operation

		staging => this state is achieved when modification to the files are been done
				   and they are queqed up to commit 
				   OR
				   (here the snapshot of the entire  repo is also taken)

		git dir => here the queqed up files which are ready to commit are commit permenantly commit to the
				   to the the DB of the git
				   OR
				   (here the snapshot are permenantly commit to the DB)

		Summary :
					The basic Git workflow goes something like this:

						a.You modify files in your working directory.

						b.You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area.

						c.You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that						  snapshot permanently to your Git directory.
